# Case Study Qualification Rules

## Purpose
This document defines what qualifies as a REAL case study for weorganize.ai.
No case study should be published on the website unless it meets ALL criteria below.

---

## Mandatory Requirements (ALL must be met)

### 1. Client Permission
- [ ] **Written permission** from the client to use their name, logo, and story
- [ ] Permission includes approval of the specific text, metrics, and quotes
- [ ] Permission is documented (email, signed release, or contract clause)
- [ ] If using a testimonial quote, client has approved the exact wording

### 2. Named Attribution
- [ ] Client company name is disclosed (no "Fortune 500 company" or "Leading retailer")
- [ ] Industry/sector is accurate
- [ ] If using a testimonial, include: full name, job title, and company
- [ ] No composite or fictional client profiles

### 3. Verifiable Metrics
Every quantitative claim MUST have:
- [ ] **Specific measurement methodology** documented
- [ ] **Baseline measurement** (what was it before?)
- [ ] **Result measurement** (what is it now?)
- [ ] **Time period** of measurement
- [ ] **Who measured it** (client's internal team, third party, etc.)
- [ ] **Date verified** with the client

**Examples of VALID metrics:**
- "Reduced document processing time from 4 hours to 23 minutes (94% reduction)"
- "Customer response time decreased from 48 hours to 2 hours, measured over 90 days"
- "Invoice processing errors reduced from 12% to 1.3%, verified by client's QA team"

**Examples of INVALID metrics:**
- "Improved efficiency" (not quantified)
- "Significant ROI" (vague)
- "Industry-leading results" (unverifiable)
- "Up to 90% improvement" (cherry-picked ceiling)
- Any percentage without baseline context

### 4. Completed Engagement
- [ ] Project has been **delivered and deployed** (not in progress)
- [ ] Results have been measured **post-deployment** (not projected)
- [ ] Sufficient time has passed to verify results are sustained (minimum 30 days post-launch)
- [ ] Client has confirmed satisfaction with the project outcome

### 5. Honest Scope
- [ ] Case study accurately describes what weorganize.ai built/did
- [ ] Does not take credit for work done by others
- [ ] Does not exaggerate the complexity or uniqueness of the solution
- [ ] Acknowledges any limitations or caveats

## What Does NOT Qualify as a Case Study

### Prohibited Content
1. **Anonymous case studies** ("A healthcare company..." or "Client A")
2. **Fabricated stories** even if "representative" of typical work
3. **Projected results** ("Expected to save..." or "Potential for...")
4. **Third-party case studies** (work done at previous employers)
5. **Composite case studies** (combining multiple projects into one narrative)
6. **Metrics without methodology** (any number without explaining how it was measured)
7. **Testimonials without attribution** ("Our clients say...")
8. **Stock photos representing clients** (only use real client logos/photos with permission)

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Round numbers (exactly 50%, 10x, etc.) - real metrics are usually messy
- Superlatives without evidence ("best in class," "industry-leading")
- Comparisons without context ("faster than competitors")
- Time savings without explaining what tasks were measured
- Cost savings without showing calculation methodology

## Interim Alternatives (What to Use Instead)

While building your case study portfolio, use these honest alternatives:

### 1. Design Partner Section
Use the `DesignPartnerSection` component to honestly communicate:
- You're in early customer phase
- What benefits partners receive
- What you're looking for in partners

### 2. Case Study Placeholder
Use the `CaseStudyPlaceholder` component to:
- Acknowledge you don't have case studies yet
- Explain why (you're waiting for verified results)
- Set expectations for when they'll be available

### 3. Capability Descriptions
Instead of case studies, describe:
- Technologies you work with (factual)
- Types of problems you solve (capability, not results)
- Your process and approach (how you work)
- Your team's background (verifiable credentials)

### 4. Open Source / Portfolio Work
If applicable:
- Personal projects with real metrics
- Open source contributions
- Published research or articles
- Speaking engagements (verifiable)

## Case Study Approval Process

Before publishing any case study:

1. **Draft** - Write the case study following the template in `CaseStudyPlaceholder.tsx`
2. **Internal Review** - Verify all metrics have documented sources
3. **Client Review** - Send to client for approval of all content
4. **Legal Review** - Ensure permission is properly documented
5. **Final Approval** - Founder sign-off before publishing

## Maintaining Integrity

Remember: **One honest case study with real numbers is worth more than ten fabricated ones.**

Prospects can spot fake case studies. The B2B world is small. Your reputation is your most valuable asset.

When in doubt, don't publish. Wait until you have something real to share.
