## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is a Proof of Concept (PoC)?
A: A PoC is a small-scale prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of an AI solution for your specific use case. We build it for free to prove value before any commitment.

Q: How long does implementation take?
A: Most projects are completed in 4-8 weeks, depending on complexity. We move fast because we've done this before at enterprise scale.

Q: Do you work with startups or only enterprises?
A: We work with mid-market companies primarily (50-500 employees), but we're open to working with growth-stage startups and larger enterprises as well.

Q: What makes you different from big consulting firms?
A: We offer enterprise-quality work at startup pricing. No junior staff, no bloated timelines, no surprise costs. Just senior engineers who've built these systems before.

Q: Do you offer ongoing support?
A: Yes, we provide ongoing maintenance and support packages. Many clients continue working with us after initial implementation for optimization and new features.
